testzeus install instructions
-----------------------------

open powershell (run as admin)

(make a development/test directory if you don't already have one...)
git clone https://github.com/test-zeus-ai/testzeus-hercules.git

cd testzeus-hercules/helper_scripts
.\hercules_windows_setup.ps1

(wait a bit)

open terminal in VS code

.\run_tests.ps1

sit in your dressing gown and eat biscuits while the AI does your job :)

once you're bored - CAREFULLY READ https://github.com/test-zeus-ai/testzeus-hercules/blob/main/docs/run_guide.md

(run on 8 components - simple tests - took 40! mins!! $2.78 for the run, 1.5mil tokens in, 47k tokens out)
(any test runner I've ever used gives you a report at the end telling you what tests passed/failed - Hercules gives nothing! you have to dig into a million XML files...)
